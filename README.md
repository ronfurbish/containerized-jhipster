# jhipster docker compose 

I created this as a quick and easy way to spin up jhipster containers so I can easily toggle between multiple versions as needed.

Working on adding one for jhipster dotnetcore, but that is still a work in progress.

If you have any feedback or would like to contribute always happy to make it better!
